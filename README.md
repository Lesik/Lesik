- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Lesik
- ðŸ’ª I'm good at TypeScript/JavaScript and web dev
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Rust

I like to contribute to free and open source projects in my free time. Because of my day job taking up most of my time, it ain't much, but it's honest work:

- Flathub, an open source Linux app store. I coded a requested feature to filter for FOSS apps only, and to highlight non-free apps.
- Copper, a PDF reader app for Android. [I coded the ability to print PDFs by integrating with Android's printing system](https://github.com/paride/CopperPDF/pull/7). [Also, I fixed a bug where the document menu would show up before the document has fully loaded.](https://github.com/paride/CopperPDF/pull/9/files)
- [Many other minor pull requests](https://github.com/search?q=author%3ALesik&type=pullrequests) that fix small coding issues, update out-of-date files or improve documentation
- [Opened over 80 issues in miscellaneous projects](https://github.com/search?q=author%3ALesik&type=issues), giving feedback, reporting bugs, etc.
